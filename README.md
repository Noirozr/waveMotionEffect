# waveMotionEffect
the whole project is inspired by the movie [The Garden of Words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Garden_of_Words). The opening is the title of the movie along with water wave effect.

The key to the effect is at the end of the animation the line of the wave becomes dotted line, and disappear. To achieve that, I use CAShapeLayer and CABasicAnimtion to draw the shape and finish the animation.
